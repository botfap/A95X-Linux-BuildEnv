<h4 class="subsection">14.2.3 Reading and Closing a Directory Stream</h4>

<p><a name="index-dirent_002eh-1457"></a>This section describes how to read directory entries from a directory
stream, and how to close the stream when you are done with it.  All the
symbols are declared in the header file <samp><span class="file">dirent.h</span></samp>.

<!-- dirent.h -->
<!-- POSIX.1 -->
<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: struct dirent * <b>readdir</b> (<var>DIR *dirstream</var>)<var><a name="index-readdir-1458"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Preliminary:
| MT-Unsafe race:dirstream
| AS-Unsafe lock
| AC-Unsafe lock
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html#POSIX-Safety-Concepts">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.

     <!-- This function holds dirstream's non-recursive lock, which brings -->
     <!-- about the usual issues with locks and async signals and cancellation, -->
     <!-- but the lock taking is not enough to make the returned value safe to -->
     <!-- use, since it points to a stream's internal buffer that can be -->
     <!-- overwritten by subsequent calls or even released by closedir. -->
        <p>This function reads the next entry from the directory.  It normally
returns a pointer to a structure containing information about the
file.  This structure is associated with the <var>dirstream</var> handle
and can be rewritten by a subsequent call.

        <p><strong>Portability Note:</strong> On some systems <code>readdir</code> may not
return entries for <samp><span class="file">.</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">..</span></samp>, even though these are always
valid file names in any directory.  See <a href="File-Name-Resolution.html#File-Name-Resolution">File Name Resolution</a>.

        <p>If there are no more entries in the directory or an error is detected,
<code>readdir</code> returns a null pointer.  The following <code>errno</code> error
conditions are defined for this function:

          <dl>
<dt><code>EBADF</code><dd>The <var>dirstream</var> argument is not valid. 
</dl>

        <p>To distinguish between an end-of-directory condition or an error, you
must set <code>errno</code> to zero before calling <code>readdir</code>.  To avoid
entering an infinite loop, you should stop reading from the directory
after the first error.

        <p>In POSIX.1-2008, <code>readdir</code> is not thread-safe.  In the GNU C Library
implementation, it is safe to call <code>readdir</code> concurrently on
different <var>dirstream</var>s, but multiple threads accessing the same
<var>dirstream</var> result in undefined behavior.  <code>readdir_r</code> is a
fully thread-safe alternative, but suffers from poor portability (see
below).  It is recommended that you use <code>readdir</code>, with external
locking if multiple threads access the same <var>dirstream</var>.

&mdash; Function: int <b>readdir_r</b> (<var>DIR *dirstream, struct dirent *entry, struct dirent **result</var>)<var><a name="index-readdir_005fr-1459"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Preliminary:
| MT-Safe
| AS-Unsafe lock
| AC-Unsafe lock
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html#POSIX-Safety-Concepts">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.

        <p>This function is a version of <code>readdir</code> which performs internal
locking.  Like <code>readdir</code> it returns the next entry from the
directory.  To prevent conflicts between simultaneously running
threads the result is stored inside the <var>entry</var> object.

        <p><strong>Portability Note:</strong> It is recommended to use <code>readdir</code>
instead of <code>readdir_r</code> for the following reasons:

          <ul>
<li>On systems which do not define <code>NAME_MAX</code>, it may not be possible
to use <code>readdir_r</code> safely because the caller does not specify the
length of the buffer for the directory entry.

          <li>On some systems, <code>readdir_r</code> cannot read directory entries with
very long names.  If such a name is encountered, the GNU C Library
implementation of <code>readdir_r</code> returns with an error code of
<code>ENAMETOOLONG</code> after the final directory entry has been read.  On
other systems, <code>readdir_r</code> may return successfully, but the
<code>d_name</code> member may not be NUL-terminated or may be truncated.

          <li>POSIX-1.2008 does not guarantee that <code>readdir</code> is thread-safe,
even when access to the same <var>dirstream</var> is serialized.  But in
current implementations (including the GNU C Library), it is safe to call
<code>readdir</code> concurrently on different <var>dirstream</var>s, so there is
no need to use <code>readdir_r</code> in most multi-threaded programs.  In
the rare case that multiple threads need to read from the same
<var>dirstream</var>, it is still better to use <code>readdir</code> and external
synchronization.

          <li>It is expected that future versions of POSIX will obsolete
<code>readdir_r</code> and mandate the level of thread safety for
<code>readdir</code> which is provided by the GNU C Library and other
implementations today. 
</ul>

        <p>Normally <code>readdir_r</code> returns zero and sets <code>*</code><var>result</var>
to <var>entry</var>.  If there are no more entries in the directory or an
error is detected, <code>readdir_r</code> sets <code>*</code><var>result</var> to a
null pointer and returns a nonzero error code, also stored in
<code>errno</code>, as described for <code>readdir</code>.

        <p>It is also important to look at the definition of the <code>struct
dirent</code> type.  Simply passing a pointer to an object of this type for
the second parameter of <code>readdir_r</code> might not be enough.  Some
systems don't define the <code>d_name</code> element sufficiently long.  In
this case the user has to provide additional space.  There must be room
for at least <code>NAME_MAX + 1</code> characters in the <code>d_name</code> array. 
Code to call <code>readdir_r</code> could look like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">            union
            {
              struct dirent d;
              char b[offsetof (struct dirent, d_name) + NAME_MAX + 1];
            } u;
          
            if (readdir_r (dir, &amp;u.d, &amp;res) == 0)
              ...
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

   <p>To support large filesystems on 32-bit machines there are LFS variants
of the last two functions.

<blockquote><p>Preliminary:

| AS-Unsafe lock
| AC-Unsafe lock
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html#POSIX-Safety-Concepts">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.

        <p>The <code>readdir64</code> function is just like the <code>readdir</code> function
except that it returns a pointer to a record of type <code>struct
dirent64</code>.  Some of the members of this data type (notably <code>d_ino</code>)
might have a different size to allow large filesystems.

        <p>In all other aspects this function is equivalent to <code>readdir</code>.

        <p>The <code>readdir64_r</code> function is equivalent to the <code>readdir_r</code>
