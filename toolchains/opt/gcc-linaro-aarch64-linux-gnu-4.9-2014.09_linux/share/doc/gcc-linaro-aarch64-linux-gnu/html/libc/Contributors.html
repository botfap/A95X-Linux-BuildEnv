   <p>Some code in the GNU C Library comes from other projects and might be under
a different license:

     <ul>
<li>The timezone support code is derived from the public-domain timezone
package by Arthur David Olson and his many contributors.

     <li>Some of the support code for Mach is taken from Mach 3.0 by CMU;
the file if_ppp.h is also copyright by CMU, but under a different license;
see the file <samp><span class="file">LICENSES</span></samp> for the text of the licenses.

     <li>The random number generation functions <code>random</code>, <code>srandom</code>,
<code>setstate</code> and <code>initstate</code>, which are also the basis for the
<code>rand</code> and <code>srand</code> functions, were written by Earl T. Cohen
for the University of California at Berkeley and are copyrighted by the
Regents of the University of California.  They have undergone minor
changes to fit into the GNU C Library and to fit the ISO&nbsp;C<!-- /@w --> standard,
but the functional code is Berkeley's.

     <li>The Internet-related code (most of the <samp><span class="file">inet</span></samp> subdirectory) and
several other miscellaneous functions and header files have been
included from 4.4 BSD with little or no modification.  The copying
permission notice for this code can be found in the file <samp><span class="file">LICENSES</span></samp>
in the source distribution.

     <li>The <code>getaddrinfo</code> and <code>getnameinfo</code> functions and supporting
code were written by Craig Metz; see the file <samp><span class="file">LICENSES</span></samp> for
details on their licensing.

     <li>The DNS resolver code is taken directly from BIND 4.9.5, which
includes copyrighted code from UC Berkeley and from Digital Equipment
Corporation.  See the file <samp><span class="file">LICENSES</span></samp> for the text of the DEC license.

     <li>The code to support Sun RPC is taken verbatim from Sun's
<span class="sc">rpcsrc-4.0</span><!-- /@w --> distribution; see the file <samp><span class="file">LICENSES</span></samp> for the
text of the license.

     <li>The math functions are taken from <code>fdlibm-5.1</code> by Sun
Microsystems, as modified by J.T. Conklin, Ian Lance Taylor,
Ulrich Drepper, Andreas Schwab, and Roland McGrath.

     <li>Many of the IEEE 64-bit double precision math functions
(in the <samp><span class="file">sysdeps/ieee754/dbl-64</span></samp> subdirectory) come
from the IBM Accurate Mathematical Library, contributed by IBM.

     <li>Many of the IA64 math functions are taken from a collection of
&ldquo;Highly Optimized Mathematical Functions for Itanium&rdquo; that Intel
makes available under a free license; see the file <samp><span class="file">LICENSES</span></samp> for
details.
