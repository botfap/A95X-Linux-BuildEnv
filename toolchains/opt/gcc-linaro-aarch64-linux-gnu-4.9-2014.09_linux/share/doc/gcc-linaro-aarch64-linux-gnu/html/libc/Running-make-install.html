<h3 class="appendixsec">C.2 Installing the C Library</h3>

<p><a name="index-installing-3911"></a>
To install the library and its header files, and the Info files of the
manual, type <code>env LANGUAGE=C LC_ALL=C make install</code>.  This will
build things, if necessary, before installing them; however, you should
still compile everything first.  If you are installing the GNU C Library as your
primary C library, we recommend that you shut the system down to
single-user mode first, and reboot afterward.  This minimizes the risk
of breaking things when the library changes out from underneath.

   <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make install</span></samp>&rsquo; will do the entire job of upgrading from a
previous installation of the GNU C Library version 2.x.  There may sometimes
be headers
left behind from the previous installation, but those are generally
harmless.  If you want to avoid leaving headers behind you can do
things in the following order.

   <p>You must first build the library (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo;), optionally check it
(&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make check</span></samp>&rsquo;), switch the include directories and then install
(&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make install</span></samp>&rsquo;).  The steps must be done in this order.  Not moving
the directory before install will result in an unusable mixture of header
files from both libraries, but configuring, building, and checking the
library requires the ability to compile and run programs against the old
library.  The new <samp><span class="file">/usr/include</span></samp>, after switching the include
directories and before installing the library should contain the Linux
headers, but nothing else.  If you do this, you will need to restore
any headers from libraries other than the GNU C Library yourself after installing the
library.

   <p>You can install the GNU C Library somewhere other than where you configured it to go
by setting the <code>install_root</code> variable on the command line for
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make install</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The value of this variable is prepended to all the
paths for installation.  This is useful when setting up a chroot
environment or preparing a binary distribution.  The directory should be
specified with an absolute file name.

   <p>The GNU C Library includes a daemon called <code>nscd</code>, which you
may or may not want to run.  <code>nscd</code> caches name service lookups; it
can dramatically improve performance with NIS+, and may help with DNS as
well.

   <p>One auxiliary program, <samp><span class="file">/usr/libexec/pt_chown</span></samp>, is installed setuid
<code>root</code> if the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--enable-pt_chown</span></samp>&rsquo; configuration option is used. 
This program is invoked by the <code>grantpt</code> function; it sets the
permissions on a pseudoterminal so it can be used by the calling process. 
If you are using a Linux kernel with the <code>devpts</code> filesystem enabled
and mounted at <samp><span class="file">/dev/pts</span></samp>, you don't need this program.

   <p>After installation you might want to configure the timezone and locale
installation of your system.  The GNU C Library comes with a locale
database which gets configured with <code>localedef</code>.  For example, to
set up a German locale with name <code>de_DE</code>, simply issue the command
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">localedef -i de_DE -f ISO-8859-1 de_DE</span></samp>&rsquo;.  To configure all locales
that are supported by the GNU C Library, you can issue from your build directory the
command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make localedata/install-locales</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>To configure the locally used timezone, set the <code>TZ</code> environment
variable.  The script <code>tzselect</code> helps you to select the right value. 
As an example, for Germany, <code>tzselect</code> would tell you to use
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">TZ='Europe/Berlin'</span></samp>&rsquo;.  For a system wide installation (the given
paths are for an installation with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--prefix=/usr</span></samp>&rsquo;), link the
timezone file which is in <samp><span class="file">/usr/share/zoneinfo</span></samp> to the file
<samp><span class="file">/etc/localtime</span></samp>.  For Germany, you might execute &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ln -s
/usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Berlin /etc/localtime</span></samp>&rsquo;.
